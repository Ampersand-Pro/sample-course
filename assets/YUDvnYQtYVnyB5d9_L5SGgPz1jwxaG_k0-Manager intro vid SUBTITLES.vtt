00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.200
It can always be a bit nerve-wracking when

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.800
you're getting ready to meet a new team.

3
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.970
Even high level executives get nervous when

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.440
they're meeting colleagues for the first

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.560
time. But it does get easier with the more

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.630
experience that you get, because along the

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.330
way, you pick up on tools and skills that

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.820
make it easier and less scary for you to

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.190
introduce yourself and engage with your new

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.610
colleagues. You should try to get to know

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.470
your colleagues because it's all part of

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.930
building your professional network.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
One way to do this is to find out which of

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.640
your colleagues you'll be working most

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.350
closely with.

16
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.410
From there, you can ask if they'd be open to

17
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.670
meeting one on one with you.

18
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.330
That makes it less intimidating when you're

19
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.580
meeting just one on one with one person

20
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.400
versus sitting in a group setting and having

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.900
the pressure of the group.

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.750
Then when it's just you and the other person,

23
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.570
you can ask more specific questions like

24
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.640
what's their background?

25
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.420
How long have they been with the company?

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.980
How do they get this job?

27
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.970
What are their responsibilities?

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.550
And then you can ask more specific questions

29
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.110
about how the two of you will be working

30
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.170
together. What kind of projects will you have

31
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.390
together? What kind of communication

32
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.250
preferences does that person have?

33
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.150
Should you set up a weekly cadence or some

34
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.940
other sort of regular update between you and

35
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.630
the other person?

36
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.090
When it comes to meetings with your manager,

37
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.330
they might already have a plan in mind for

38
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.460
how often you'll be meeting with each other.

39
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.630
This might be once a week or every other day

40
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.560
. Regardless of the cadence or how you'll be

41
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.990
meeting, because it might be over video call

42
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.260
or just an audio call, it's really important

43
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.330
that you set up regular touch points between

44
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.970
you and your manager, because this is a way

45
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.400
how you stay on top of your projects and any

46
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.140
updates between the two of you.

47
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.440
It's really easy without regular touch points

48
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.840
for details to fall through the cracks.

49
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.470
If your manager has not yet proposed a

50
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.680
structure for a regular cadence between the

51
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.500
two of you, this is something that you can

52
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.700
take initiative on your own.

53
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.510
Think about what would be most helpful for

54
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.690
you. How often would you like to meet with

55
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.330
your manager?

56
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.060
How often would you like to meet over a video

57
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.160
call versus just an audio call?

58
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.530
How long should these be?

59
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.590
Start putting some thought into this and then

60
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.280
you can propose the cadence to your manager.

61
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.250
Just be ready that they might not be as

62
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.000
available as you'd like them to be.

63
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.110
They're busy with a lot of things going on,

64
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.470
but this is one way to open the door and to

65
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.900
come to a compromise so that you find a

66
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.590
cadence that works for you both.

67
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.430
Again, this is a great way for you to show

68
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.980
initiative and interest in engaging with your

69
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.980
manager. Coming up, we'll talk about tips for

70
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.990
growing your relationship with your manager,

71
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.150
feedback best practices and tips on conflict

72
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910
resolution in the workplace.
